            <h1>About Streamify</h1>
            <p>
                Streamify is a movie discovery app that helps the users to find details about the movies they love.
                It is basically an academic project developed for the purpose of learning React and Bootstrap. <br />
                The build tool used for this project is <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/">Vite</a>.
                <br />
                <strong> Why??</strong><br />
                Well because it is fast, and I am a beginner ðŸ˜…. <em> Plus the React developer team recently removed `&quotcreate-react-app&quot` from the official documentation, meaning, it is no longer the default method of setting up a new project in React. And fact check, this happened in 2023 ðŸ˜¯, did you know that!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The app uses the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">The Movie Database (TMDb) API</a> to fetch the movie data.
                The details of the movies are fetched from the API and displayed to the user. The design of the app is also inspired by the TMDb website.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                Haha! There is no team behind this project. It is developed by a single person ðŸ˜‚, who is as new to React as you might be.
